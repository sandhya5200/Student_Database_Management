Overview:
This project is built using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy to manage a student database. It stores details like student ID, name, class (standard), place (location), and optionally, their photo.
The project consists of several Python files working together to create, read, update, and delete student records.

Key Components:
Database Setup (database.py):

SQLAlchemy Configuration: SQLAlchemy is used to handle database operations with PostgreSQL. The connection is established using credentials (username, password, host, and database name).
Session Management: A function get_db is provided to manage database sessions, ensuring proper opening and closing, preventing resource leaks.
Model Definition (models.py):

GraduateDetails Class: This defines the structure of the GraduateDetails table in the database using SQLAlchemy's ORM. It includes fields for student ID, name, class, place, and photo (stored as binary data).
CRUD Operations (crud.py):

Insert Function: This function inserts multiple student records into the GraduateDetails table. It handles errors gracefully, ensuring changes are rolled back if issues arise to maintain data integrity.
Main Application (main.py):

Student Class: This class represents student data in the application.
Database Initialization: The call to Base.metadata.create_all() ensures the GraduateDetails table is created if it doesn't already exist.
Data Insertion: Predefined student records are inserted into the database using the insert_students function when the application starts.
API Endpoints (api.py):

Create Student: This endpoint allows adding a new student, including details like name, class, place, and an optional photo. If the ID already exists, an error is returned.
Update Student: This endpoint updates existing student information, including the photo.
Retrieve Student: This allows retrieving student details or their photo. If photo=true is specified, only the photo is returned; otherwise, the rest of the student's information is provided.
Delete Student: This endpoint deletes a student record based on their ID.
Workflow:
Creating the Database and Table: At startup, the application checks if the required table (sandhya_table) exists in the database and creates it if needed.
Adding Students: Predefined students are added to the database using the insert_students function.
Interacting with the API:
The API allows adding, updating, retrieving, and deleting student records.
Photos are uploaded and stored as binary data in the database, and can be retrieved as a file (e.g., JPEG).
The API provides the option to retrieve either a student's details or their photo, but not both simultaneously.
Special Considerations:
Error Handling: The project ensures error handling for cases like attempting to add a duplicate student ID or accessing a non-existent student or photo.
File Management: For student photos, the API can serve the stored binary data as image files when requested.
Summary:
This project creates a reliable system for managing student data using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy, with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. 
Its modular structure, with separate files handling different tasks, makes it easy to maintain and extend.
